# linux_cyber_unit

I teach a high school Introduction to Computer Programming course. In that course, I introduce some very basic cybersecurity concepts in a short unit that begins with an intro to linux and concludes with working through modules in tryhackme.com.  
This repro is a general discription of that unit.

## Raspberry Pi 
I use Raspberry Pis for this, but any linux desktop should work.  

## Linux Basics and Nano
The purpose of this section is to provide an opportunity for learners to: 
- play around with linux desktop by editing their preferences...
- begin using some basic terminal commands (ls, cd, mkdir, touch...)
- create a directory and files on the desktop using terminal commands
- use nano editor to edit .txt and .py files inside the terminal
