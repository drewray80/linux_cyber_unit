# Hosting and SSH 

The purpose of this section is to provide an opportunity for learners to:
- learn about servers and clients through locally hosting a website
- learn about IP address (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, static IP addresses...)
- experience headless access to a linux terminal through ssh
- run a single python http server and see the traffic coming to their website/server
- also it's fun for them to make a simple site that their classmates can pull up on their pi
