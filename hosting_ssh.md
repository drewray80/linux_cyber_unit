# Hosting and SSH 

The purpose of this section is to provide an opportunity for learners to:
- learn about servers and clients through locally hosting a website
- learn about IP address (IPv4, IPv6, DNS, static IP addresses...)
- experience headless access to a linux terminal through ssh
- run a single python http server and see the traffic coming to their website/server
- also it's fun for them to make a simple site that their classmates can pull up on their pi

## History and Grading
Since students do not have access to the internet, submitting this assignment can be difficult.  
I usually grade this assignment by having students show me their edited site while I walk around and check off their names on a list.  
You could also have them show you their terminal command history by having them run the *history* command when they finish.
