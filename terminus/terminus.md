Terminus was created by MIT students to help people learn and practice terminal commands.  
It is a challenging and entertaining text based game that has a retro feel that students enjoy.  

The game is a choose your own adventure text based game.  
The questions in the documents prompt the students to move through the game to answer the questions.  
It looks like a terminal on the left side of the screen and shows pixel art on the right side.

## Cyber.org

I discovered this game through a Cyber.org activity.  
I use questions from the cyber.org activity in my class.  
I am posting the questions that I use in my class that the activity provides.  
Cyber.org also provides additional slides for presenting the activity and answer keys.  
I am not posting those, but they are available to educators through cyber.org.  

Or you can just search for Terminus and your will find many websites with resources.
