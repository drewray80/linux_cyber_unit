# Linux Basics and Nano

The purpose of this section is to provide an opportunity for learners to:
- play around with linux desktop by editing their preferences...
- begin using some basic terminal commands (ls, cd, mkdir, touch...)
- create a directory and files on the desktop using terminal commands
- use nano editor to edit .txt and .py files inside the terminal

## Raspberry Pi Setup
The first step that we take in this Linux/Cyber unit is to boot a raspberry pi linux desktop.  
It can take a few minutes to boot and setup the pis and some students will have more trouble with this than others.  
I let students know that they can change their desktop preferences in anyway they like.  This gives the students something to do while other students are getting theirs setup.  And I have found that all students like to change background images, fonts...

This is initial screen that comes up when they boot the desktop.

This is my desktop after I change the preferences. (I show mine to my students.)

## Basic Terminal Commands
Once everyone has their pi running and are finished adjusting the preferences, I have them open a terminal window.  I spend some time explaining that the terminal how we control a computer without having to build a GUI or desktop.  And that if we access a computer remotely like a server, that the terminal is all we will have.  
(We do activity for remoting into their pis using ssh, so I let them know that they will need work using on the terminal very soon.)

It is important for their terminal to be sized so that it only covers half of the screen (the right half).  This lets them see directories and files appear on the desktop as they create them.  
With the terminal open, we go through a few basic commands for navigating the directories and files from the terminal. (If you are not familiar with linux commands, you can just search for they commands that are in my pictures to find more information.) 

ls, cd <*file or dir name*>, cd, cd .. (plus any other commands that you want to demonstrate)

## Create a Directory 

Then I have them navigate to their Desktop directory.
Create a directory (*using mkdir*) on their desktop and cd into it.  
It will appear where they can see it on the desktop.

Then I have them open their new directory by double clicking on the desktop folder, so they can see the effects of our terminal commands.

Next, we use the *touch* command to create a text file in our directory.  
This shows them how to create a file and gives us the most basic file to edit in the nano editor.

They will see the text file appear in the desktop folder.
I also have them us the *ls* command to list the items in the directory from the terminal.  
This lets them see that the new file is visiable in terminal as well.
